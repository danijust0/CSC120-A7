Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
Cafe:
- restock()
If there are no parameters, restock() will add materials in default amounts. I thought that this would make the process quicker. 
- sellCoffee()
If there are no parameters, this method will sell a cup of coffee with default amounts of sugar and cream. I also thought that this would make it easier to sell coffee because when people order coffee, they usually just order cream and sugar with no exact amount. This method will make it quicker to sell cups of coffee to those people. 
Library:
- printCollection()
With this method, users have the option of simply printing out the titles, or printing out the titles and the availibilities of the books. I thought that this would be useful, because users have an option to limit or broaden their results. 
- addTitle()
With this method, users can add titles that do not have a known name or author. This would be useful in the rare case that a book comes in that has no available title or author. 
House:
- moveIn()
I made it so that if you don't have a parameter, you automatically move yourself in. I thought this would be useful because you are not only able to move yourself in, but you don't have to go through the effort of typing in your name when you do so.  
- moveOut()
I made it so that if you don't have a parameter, you automatically move yourself out. I thought this would make it easy to add and remove yourself from a house. 


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
In classes like library and house, I couldn't find useful ways to implement overloading. Perhaps a better understanding of its function and ways to use it will allow me to find more uses for it in cases like these. Other than that, using classes and inheritance are becoming a lot easier for me. I now understand the relationships between objects alot quicker.
